<p> How would you describe a cricket?

Crickets are medium-sized to large insects. Like their relatives the grasshoppers and katydids, they have chewing mouthparts, and their back legs are larger and stronger than than the other two pair. They have rounded heads, antennae that are long and thin, and their wings bend down on the sides of their body.

</body>Species Information
<br>What is the scientific name and classification of crickets?
Crickets are insects that are part of the Gryllidae family (“true crickets”) and belong to the order Orthoptera. They are related to bush crickets and somewhat more loosely related to grasshoppers.<BR>
<br>How many different types or species of crickets exist?
There are approximately 900 different species of crickets in the Gryllidae family. About one hundred of them can be found in the United States.<BR>
<br>What are the primary characteristics of the cricket?<BR> <br>
Gryllidae, or true crickets, have powerful hind legs, two pairs of wings, flattened bodies and antennae that can be as long or longer than their body.
<br>How did crickets evolve?
Crickets diverged from other Orthopterans (like katydids and grasshoppers) in the Triassic period about 250–200 million years ago. They continued this divergence through the Triassic and Jurassic periods (~200–145 million years ago).<BR>
<br>What does the cricket represent in various cultures?<BR> <br>
In many parts of the world, particularly China, crickets are thought to bring good luck.<BR>

 

<Habitat & Diet<br>
<br>Where are crickets found in the world?<BR> <br>
Crickets are found all across the world except in cold regions at latitudes higher than around 55 degrees North and South. The largest diversity of crickets occurs in tropical regions. The black field crickets are the most common variety in the United States.<BR>
<br>Where do crickets live?<BR> <br>
Crickets usually live in logs founds within meadows, under rocks, along roadsides and in pastures. Most cricket species live on the ground, however some reside underground, in trees or within caves.<BR>
What do crickets eat?<BR> <br>
Crickets are omnivores and primarily scavengers. They consume fungi, decaying plants and, on rare occasions, dead or injured crickets. Crickets use their antennae, called feelers, to help with the discovery of food and detect the movement of prey. Crickets are usually a welcome addition to gardens as they eat insects that destroy plants such as aphids and ants.
When are crickets most active
Crickets are nocturnal, meaning they sleep during the day and are most active during the night.
Reproduction & Lifespan<BR>
How long do crickets live?<BR> <br>
Most crickets live between 30 and 90 days.<BR>
How do crickets mate and reproduce?<BR> <br>
Crickets mate beginning in late spring and ending in early fall. The male perform a mating dance that can last from a few minutes to hours long and performs a unique mating chrip. Interestingly, the female cricket mounts the male cricket to receive the a sperm packet and may mate with several males before deciding which sperm from which male to accept. The female then lays her eggs in soil, one-at-a-time, or in small groups within plant material. She may lay anywhere from a dozen up to a couple hundred eggs. After about two weeks, baby crickets (nymphs) will emerge.
What are the characteristics of cricket babies?<BR> <br>
When crickets are born, they look very much like adults, however, they do not have wings.<BR>
How do crickets care for their young?<BR> <br>
Crickets lay eggs in large numbers, and when the eggs hatch, the young crickets are on their own to survive. However, certain species of crickets, like the burrowing cricket will care for its young for a few days after hatching.<BR>
Do crickets live in groups or alone?<BR> <br>
For the most part, crickets are semi-solitary (or “subsocial”) insects. Unlike ants or bees, crickets tend to live mostly solitary lives and, in fact, will fight one another when in close quarters.<BR>
Predators & Defense<BR>
What are cricket predators (what animals eat crickets)?<BR> <br>
The primary natural predators of the cricket are lizards, frogs, salamanders, spiders and tortoises. Increasingly, humans are also consuming crickets as they provide a nutritious and sustainable food source.<BR>
How do crickets protect themselves from predators?<BR> <br>
Crickets generally don’t defend themselves, but instead avoid capture by hiding or quickly hopping away from predators.<BR>
Do crickets bite and are crickets dangerous to humans?<BR> <br>
Some crickets do bite, but in the United States, it is very uncommon.  Crickets don’t delivery venom and are not know to carry diseases that could harm humans.<BR>
Intelligence & Communication<BR>
How intelligent are crickets?<BR> <br>
Unlike bees or ants, which are arguably somewhat intelligent via social learning behaviours and adaptations, crickets are not considered to be particularly intelligent among insect species.<BR>
How do crickets communicate?<BR> <br>
Crickets communicate by chirping and the chirps are species specific. Crickets use chirping to attract females or repel other males. The scientific name for cricket chirping is called “stridulation.” Crickets make this chirping sound by rubbing their wings together. One wing has a set of 50 to 300 “teeth” (like a comb) which is then rubbed against the upper hind edge of the other wing to produce the sound.
How do they hear the chirps?<BR> <br>
They have a special auditory organ on their forelegs that allows them to detect these chirps.<BR>
